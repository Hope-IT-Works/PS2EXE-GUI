## Development Progress

PS2EXE-GUI is still in development but is usable.

As you may have noticed, the project has not been updated for a while. I will get back to it as soon as possible. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

[^extractable]: Allows you to choose, if the user can extract the `.ps1` out of the `.exe` file. Is and will not be supported by [PS2EXE](https://github.com/MScholtes/Win-PS2EXE/blob/master/ps2exe.ps1) by default ([issue](https://github.com/MScholtes/TechNet-Gallery/issues/3)), but PS2EXE-GUI takes care of this.
